# Implementation Plan - T1A3 Katie Lock

## Stage One - Idea and Approval

My app idea was posted onto Discord on 22 April 2023 for educator approval:
> *My app idea is inspired by the WFDF Rules Accreditation (https://rules.wfdf.org/accreditation) for Ultimate Frisbee, but to make a simplified terminal application (and making sure the questions are in plain English without double negatives like the real version - my pet peeve!!!)*

> *The features of this app would be:*
> - *User registration - users are required to sign in or sign up for the app using a unique email address.*
> - *Quiz - the main part of the app! The users will be given a random selection of multi-choice questions from a linked csv file. The questions will be answered via user input. Their scores will be kept and they will be given their grade at the end.*
> - *Register of certified players - if a passing score is registered, the user will be added to another file which contains all players who have successfully passed the quiz, along with the date that the test was passed.*

> *Open to a different idea if you think it could be an IP issue, though I have contacts at WFDF if a clearance from them would help!*

This idea was approved by Simon:

Now that my app idea has been approved, the Implementation Plan needs to be prepared and loaded into a Project Management tool in order to track over the next two weeks.

## Stage Two - Feature Flowcharts
Before writing any code or creating a timeline for implementation, I firstly need to scope out the features I listed in my idea above.  This will help conceptualise *how* each feature works logically, breaking down all possible steps or paths within a feature.

Due to the depth in the Quiz feature of the app, this has been split to a separate page in the flowchart to assist with ease of reading:

One new feature was added when building this flowchart - **Previous Results**.  This will allow users to see to see their own previous attempts at the quiz, rather than only being able to see if they were previously successful through the Certified Players feature.

## Stage x - Planning Python Structures

Now that I have visualised the logic behind each feature using the flowcharts above, I can start to plan which Python structures I plan to use in order to meet the assessment requirements, and where.  This should make my coding time quicker, and increase the chances that my application will meet the rubric criteria of this assessment.
