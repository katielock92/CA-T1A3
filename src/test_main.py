"""This module contains the unit tests for this application.

To run the tests, the application will need to be available through your
machine and Pytest will need to be installed.  This will automatically install
if the application is launched via run.sh.

Once the application and Pytest are installed, in the terminal navigate
to the src folder of the application and in the command line, enter 'pytest'.

7 tests should show as passing - if any errors occur, please contact the app creator.
