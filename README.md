# Coder Academy Term 1 Assignment 3 - Katie Lock

## README Requirements:

1. Answer to all the documentation requirements below.

2. Your README.md should have a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.

3. Provide full attribution to the referenced sources (where applicable).

4. Provide a link to your source control repository.

5. Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to. Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

6. Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
    - at least THREE features
    - describe each feature

    Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
    - use of variables and the concept of variable scope
    - loops and conditional control structures
    - error handling

    Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient.

7. Develop an implementation plan which:
    - outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
    - prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
    - provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist item

    Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan. Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan.

    Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

8. Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

    You must include:
    - steps to install the application
    - any dependencies required by the application to operate
    - any system/hardware requirements
    - how to use any command line arguments made for the application.

## Presentation Requirements:

A slide-deck must be created and video presentation recorded of you running through this slide deck.

This presentation much include:

- A walk-through of your Terminal application, its features and how it used
- A walk-through of the logic of your Terminal application and code (ensure to run through the important parts of your code, including any crucial application logic)
- A review of your development/build process including challenges, ethical issues, favourite parts, etc

The maximum time for the presentation is 10 minutes.

## Code Requirements:

- Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:
    - variables and variable scope
    - loops and conditional control structures
    - write and utilise simple functions **(FOR HD: SIX OR MORE WRITTEN, USE AT LEAST FIVE OF THESE)**
    - error handling
    - input and output **(FOR HD: TWO OR MORE)**
    - importing a Python package **(FOR HD: FOUR OR MORE)**
    - using functions from a Python package **(FOR HD: EXTENSIVE USE OF ONE OR MORE)**

- Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

- Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

- Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan. **(FOR HD: NO ERRORS)**

- Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

    Each test should:
    - cover a different feature of the application
    - state what is being tested
    - provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

    > An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application.

- Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
    - making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes **(FOR HD: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN 20 COMMITS)**
    - pushing all commits to a remote repository

- Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application.  For example: writing a script which turns the application into an executable.
